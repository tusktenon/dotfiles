### Input Configuration ················································· {{{1

# You can get the names of your inputs by running: swaymsg -t get_inputs.
# Read `man 5 sway-input` for more information about this section.

input type:keyboard {
    repeat_delay 300
    repeat_rate 30
}

# Modern mouse behaviour
focus_follows_mouse no

input type:touchpad {
    pointer_accel 0.25
    scroll_factor 0.75
    dwt enabled
    tap enabled
    click_method clickfinger

### Output Configuration ················································ {{{1

# Run `swaymsg -t get_outputs` to get a list of output names.
#   Output eDP-1: LG gram laptop monitor: 2560x1600 @ 60 Hz
#   Output DP-2: Dell U2720Q monitor (via USB-C): 3840x2160 @ 60 Hz

# Any scaling factor has to be figured into relative positions:
#   ((3840 - 2160)/2)/1.5 = 427
#                2160/1.5 = 1440

output eDP-1 scale 1.5
output DP-2 scale 1.5
output eDP-1 pos 427 1440
output DP-2 pos 0 0

# Clamshell mode: disable the laptop's monitor when the lid is closed
bindswitch --reload --locked lid:on output eDP-1 disable
bindswitch --reload --locked lid:off output eDP-1 enable


### Idle configuration ·················································· {{{1

# Example configuration:
#
# exec swayidle -w \
#          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
#          timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
#          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
#
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.


### Status Bar ·························································· {{{1
