#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Dan Murphy
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle ~/.emacs.d/init.el :mkdirp yes

* Introduction

This Org Mode document generates the Emacs configuration file [[file:init.el][init.el]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; NOTE: Do not edit this file directly: init.el is generated from Emacs.org.
  ;; Edit that file in Emacs and run org-bable-tangle (C-c C-v C-t) to update
  ;; init.el automatically.

#+end_src

* Package System Setup

Emacs has a built-in package manager (=package.el=), but [[https://github.com/raxod502/straight.el][straight.el]] is a more advanced alternative with a number of useful features. In particular, =straight.el= can install and update packages from their repositories, letting you add packages that aren't in ELPA or MELPA. 

Some  useful commands:
- =straight-pull-all= will upgrade all of your active packages once you restart Emacs.
- =straight-check-all= will upgrade all of your active packages while Emacs is running.
- =straight-remove-unused-repos= will delete unused repository folders. Note that if you just want to uninstall a package, you can simply remove the corresponding line from your configuration.

[[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] makes configuration and loading of packages much easier. =straight.el= provides full =use-package= integration.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; straight.el bootstrap script
  (defvar bootstrap-version)
  (let ((bootstrap-file
         (expand-file-name "straight/repos/straight.el/bootstrap.el" user-emacs-directory))
        (bootstrap-version 5))
    (unless (file-exists-p bootstrap-file)
      (with-current-buffer
          (url-retrieve-synchronously
           "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raxod502/straight.el/develop/install.el"
           'silent 'inhibit-cookies)
        (goto-char (point-max))
        (eval-print-last-sexp)))
    (load bootstrap-file nil 'nomessage))

  ;; Install =use-package= with =straight.el=
  (straight-use-package 'use-package)

  ;; =use-package= forms invoke =straight.el= to install packages,
  ;; unless specified otherwise.
  ;; This is analogous to setting =use-package-always-ensure= with =package.el=
  (setq straight-use-package-by-default t)

#+end_src

* Keybindings

[[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil][Evil]] is an extensible vi layer for Emacs. It emulates the main features of Vim, turning Emacs into a modal editor. [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][Evil Collection]] provides additional bindings for the parts of Emacs that Evil does not cover. [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-surround][Evil Surround]] emulates Tim Pope's [[https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround][surround.vim]] plugin.

[[https://github.com/noctuid/general.el][General]] provides a convenient method for adding keybindings; in particular, we can use General to return to normal state with 'jk'.

I want =C-u= to follow Vim's behaviour: scroll up by half a screen in normal state, delete back to indentation in insert state. By default, however, =C-u= is bound in Emacs to the =universal-argument= prefix, which you may want to rebind to something else.

Evil can be use one of three undo systems:
  - =undo-fu=, in which case the [[https://gitlab.com/ideasman42/emacs-undo-fu][Undo Fu]] package must be installed;
  - =undo-tree=, in which case the [[https://www.dr-qubit.org/undo-tree.html][Undo Tree]] package must be installed and =undo-tree-mode= must be activated;
  - =undo-redo=, which uses commands natively available in Emacs 28.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Make ESC quit prompts
  (global-set-key (kbd "<escape>") 'keyboard-escape-quit)

  (use-package general
    :config
    (general-evil-setup t)
    (general-imap "j"
      (general-key-dispatch 'self-insert-command
        :timeout 0.25
        "k" 'evil-normal-state)))

  ;; If you switch to undo-redo in Emacs 28, you can remove the following line
  (use-package undo-fu)

  (use-package evil
    :init
    (setq evil-want-integration t   ; required by evil-collection
          evil-want-keybinding nil  ; required by evil-collection
          evil-want-Y-yank-to-eol t
          evil-want-C-u-delete t
          evil-want-C-u-scroll t
          evil-undo-system 'undo-fu)  ; try undo-redo when Emacs 28 is released
    :config
    (evil-mode 1)
    (define-key evil-insert-state-map (kbd "C-h") 'evil-delete-backward-char-and-join)

    ;; Use visual line motions even outside of visual-line-mode buffers
    (evil-global-set-key 'motion "j" 'evil-next-visual-line)
    (evil-global-set-key 'motion "k" 'evil-previous-visual-line)

    (evil-set-initial-state 'messages-buffer-mode 'normal)
    (evil-set-initial-state 'dashboard-mode 'normal))

  (use-package evil-collection
    :after evil
    :config
    (evil-collection-init))

  (use-package evil-surround
    :config
    (global-evil-surround-mode 1))

#+end_src

Evil does not seem to include a direct analog of (Neo)Vim's "highlighted yank" feature. The [[https://github.com/edkolev/evil-goggles][evil-goggles]] package does this and more, adding visual hints for most Evil edit operations. However, if you only want the highlighted yank, you can follow the instructions in [[https://blog.meain.io/2020/emacs-highlight-yanked/][this blog post]] to write your own (surprisingly simple) function, which makes use of the built-in =pulse.el= .

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq pulse-delay 0.04)
  (setq pulse-iterations 10)

  (defun efs/evil-highlight-yank (orig-fn beg end &rest args)
    "Advice to be added to 'evil-yank' to highlight yanked region."
    (pulse-momentary-highlight-region beg end)
    (apply orig-fn beg end args))

  (advice-add 'evil-yank :around 'efs/evil-highlight-yank) 

#+end_src

* Appearance and Interface

** Basic Interface Settings

Unnecesary visual elements have been disabled, but the menu bar can be helpful while you're learning Emacs, so you may wish to leave it enabled. Alternatively, you can toggle the use of the menu bar with =M-x menu-bar-mode=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Set default dimensions for new frames
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 101))
  (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 51))

  ;; Disable startup screen
  (setq inhibit-startup-message t) 

  ;; Disable the menu bar, scroll bar, tool bar and tooltips
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (scroll-bar-mode -1)
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (tooltip-mode -1)

  (set-fringe-mode 12)  ; Set left and right margins

  (global-visual-line-mode 1)  ; Visually wrap long lines

  (blink-cursor-mode 0)  ; Disable blinking cursor

  ;; Enable line numbers globally, then disable them for specific modes
  (setq display-line-numbers-type 'relative)
  (global-display-line-numbers-mode t)

  (dolist (mode '(eshell-mode-hook
                  shell-mode-hook
                  term-mode-hook
                  vterm-mode-hook))
  (add-hook mode (lambda () (display-line-numbers-mode 0))))

#+end_src

** Fonts

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Iosevka" :height 160)
  (set-face-attribute 'fixed-pitch nil :font "Iosevka" :height 160)
  (set-face-attribute 'variable-pitch nil :font "Lato" :height 160)

#+end_src

** Color Theme

[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][doom-themes]] is an excellent collection of high-quality themes with support for many different Emacs modes. Take a look at the [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes/tree/screenshots][screenshots]] to find one you like. I'll also add the excellent [[https://www.nordtheme.com/ports/emacs][Nord theme]]. You can quickly switch between themes with =M-x load-theme=.

[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-solaire-mode][Solaire mode]] helps to visually distinguish "real" buffers (that is, the file-visiting code buffers where you do most of your work) from "unreal" buffers (popups, sidebars, log buffers, terminals, etc.) by giving the latter a slightly different (lighter or darker) background.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package doom-themes
    :init (load-theme 'doom-one t))

  (use-package nord-theme)

  (use-package solaire-mode
    :config (solaire-global-mode +1))

#+end_src

** Parenthesis Matching
   
Show Paren mode highlights matching delimiters. [[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]] makes it easier to visually match brackets and parentheses in code buffers.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (show-paren-mode 1)

  (use-package rainbow-delimiters
    :hook (prog-mode . rainbow-delimiters-mode))

#+end_src

** Indentation Guides

[[https://github.com/DarthFennec/highlight-indent-guides][highlight-indent-guides]] adds visual guides for indentation levels. Toggle with =M-x highlight-indent-guides-mode= (you may want to set up a binding for this).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package highlight-indent-guides
    :hook (c-mode-common . highlight-indent-guides-mode)
    :config (setq highlight-indent-guides-method 'character
                  highlight-indent-guides-responsive 'nil))

#+end_src

** Mode Line

[[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline][doom-modeline]] is a very attractive mode-line configuration. The default configuration is quite good but you can check out the [[https://github.com/seagle0128/doom-modeline#customize][configuration options]] for more things you can enable or disable.

*NOTE:* The first time you load your configuration on a new machine, you'll need to run =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts= so that mode-line icons display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  ;; Display column number in mode line
  (column-number-mode)

  (use-package all-the-icons)

  (use-package doom-modeline
    :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
    :custom ((doom-modeline-height 40)
             (doom-modeline-indent-info t)))

  (set-face-attribute 'mode-line nil :font "Source Sans Pro" :height 160)
  (set-face-attribute 'mode-line-inactive nil :font "Source Sans Pro" :height 160)

#+end_src

** Completion System

*** TODO: Add Vertico-based completion system

Emacs includes several built-in completion packages (Ido and Icomplete), but many users prefer [[https://emacs-helm.github.io/helm/][Helm]] or [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper][Ivy]]. [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]] and its complementary packages are designed around an alternative philosophy that I find very appealing:
- Vertico provides a  new completion UI but uses Emacs's built-in completion mechanics. This means a small code base, excellent performance, and automatic compatibility with other packages.
- Unlike the heavyweight, monolithic Helm and Ivy, the Vertico "ecosystem" consists of independent packages, each responsible for a specific element of the completion interface:
    - [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]]: vertical completion UI.
    - [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][Corfu]]: the =completion-in-region= counterpart to Vertico.
    - [[https://github.com/minad/consult][Consult]]: useful search and navigation commands; analagous to Counsel and Swiper in Ivy.
    - [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][Marginalia]]: annotations for minibuffer completions; analagous to Ivy Rich.
    - [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]]: advanced completion style.
    - [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark]]: actions and context menu for the minibuffer.

To really understand what each of these components is doing, it's best to introduce them one at a time: see [[https://github.com/minad/vertico#complementary-packages][this approach]] suggested by the author of Vertico.

*** Completions with Vertico

Because Vertico uses Emacs's native completion system, we can use the built-in =savehist-mode= to preserve minibuffer history.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package savehist
    :config
    (setq history-length 16)
    :init
    (savehist-mode))

  ;; Taken from David Wilson's Emacs configuration
  (defun efs/minibuffer-backward-kill (arg)
    "When minibuffer is completing a file name delete up to parent
    folder, otherwise delete a word"
    (interactive "p")
    (if minibuffer-completing-file-name
        (if (string-match-p "/." (minibuffer-contents))
            (zap-up-to-char (- arg) ?/)
          (delete-minibuffer-contents))
      (delete-word (- arg))))

  (use-package vertico
    :bind (:map vertico-map
                ("C-j" . vertico-next)
                ("C-k" . vertico-previous)
                :map minibuffer-local-map
                ;;("M-h" . efs/minibuffer-backward-kill))
                ("<backspace>" . efs/minibuffer-backward-kill))
    :custom
    (vertico-cycle t)
    :init
    (vertico-mode))

#+end_src

*** Advanced Completion Candidate Filtering with Orderless

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package orderless
    :custom (completion-styles '(orderless)))

#+end_src

** Help System

[[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is a useful UI panel that appears when you start pressing any key binding in Emacs to offer you all possible completions for the prefix.  For example, if you press =C-c= (hold control and press the letter =c=), a panel will appear at the bottom of the frame displaying all of the bindings under that prefix and which command they run.  This is very useful for learning the possible key bindings in the mode of your current buffer.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

(use-package which-key
  :init (which-key-mode)
  :diminish which-key-mode
  :config
  (setq which-key-idle-delay 0.5))

#+end_src

[[https://github.com/Wilfred/helpful][Helpful]] adds a lot of very helpful (get it?) information to Emacs' =describe-= command buffers.  For example, if you use =describe-function=, you will not only get the documentation about the function, you will also see the source code of the function and where it gets used in other places in the Emacs configuration.  It is very useful for figuring out how things work in Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package helpful
    :commands (helpful-callable helpful-variable helpful-command helpful-key)
    :bind
    ([remap describe-command] . helpful-command)
    ([remap describe-function] . helpful-function)
    ([remap describe-key] . helpful-key)
    ([remap describe-symbol] . helpful-symbol)  ; try helpful-at-point?
    ([remap describe-variable] . helpful-variable))

#+end_src

* Basic Editing Settings

Don't make backup files.
Default to an indentation of 2 spaces, and use spaces instead of tabs (a.k.a. 'soft' tabs).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (setq make-backup-files nil)

  (setq-default tab-width 2)
  (setq-default evil-shift-width tab-width)
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)

  ;; Disable <> auto-pairing
  (setq electric-pair-inhibit-predicate
    `(lambda (c)
      (if (char-equal c ?<) t (,electric-pair-inhibit-predicate c))))

#+end_src

* Dired

Dired is Emacs's excellent file manager. With the [[https://github.com/crocket/dired-single][dired-single]] package, Emacs will reuse existing Dired buffers instead of spawning new ones.

[[https://github.com/jtbm37/all-the-icons-dired][all-the-icons-dired]] adds Dired support to all-the-icons. If you use Treemacs, an alternative is [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs#treemacs-icons-dired][treemacs-icons-dired]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package dired
    :straight nil
    :commands (dired dired-jump)
    :bind (("C-x C-j" . dired-jump))
    :custom ((dired-listing-switches "-agho --group-directories-first"))

    (setq dired-open-extensions '(("pdf" . "okular")
                                  ("png" . "gwenview")
                                  ("mkv" . "vlc"))))

  (use-package dired-hide-dotfiles

* Shells & Terminals

** vterm

[[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/][vterm]] is a terminal emulator for Emacs based on [[https://github.com/neovim/libvterm][libvterm]], a C library developped by the Neovim project. Compared to term and ansi-term (Emacs's built-in terminal emulators), vterm provides much better performance, as well as superior compatibility with terminal applications.

Before installing vterm, make sure your system has the required packages installed. On an Arch-based system, these are =cmake=, =libtool= and (optionally) =libvterm=. Also, be sure to read the [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/#shell-side-configuration][Shell-side configuration]] and [[https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/#directory-tracking-and-prompt-tracking][Directory tracking and Prompt tracking]] sections of the vterm README: you need to add the =vterm_printf= and =vterm_prompt_end= functions to your shell's configuration file (=.bashrc= or =.zshrc=).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package vterm
    :commands vterm
    :config
    (setq vterm-shell "zsh")
    (setq vterm-max-scrollback 1000))

#+end_src

** eshell

/TODO./ eshell is a Bash-like shell written in elisp. Though slower than vterm and lacking some features of bash and zsh, it offers superior Emacs integration and a consistent experience across all OSes.

* Version Control

** Magit

[[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] is an outstanding Git interface for Emacs. [[https://github.com/magit/forge][Forge]] allows you to work with Git forges, such as GitHub and GitLab, from the comfort of Magit and the rest of Emacs.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package magit
    :commands magit-status
    :custom
    (magit-display-buffer-function #'magit-display-buffer-same-window-except-diff-v1))

#+end_src

** Git Gutter

[[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/git-gutter][git-gutter]] highlights uncommited changes in the margin of the window. [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/git-gutter-fringe][git-gutter-fringe]] is a variation of git-gutter that uses the fringe rather than the margin. Keep in mind that the fringe only appears in graphical Emacs buffers, so you cannot use git-gutter-fringe in the terminal. An alternative package is [[https://github.com/dgutov/diff-hl][diff-hl]].

Note that both git-gutter-fringe and diff-hl will conflict with other modes that put indicators in the fringe, notably [[https://www.flycheck.org/][Flycheck]]. A [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/git-gutter-fringe/issues/9#issuecomment-611712558][good solution]] (used in [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/blob/cdaa55b4dbfebe6c81ab92af6a7c9bc20f68f3a6/modules/ui/vc-gutter/config.el#L119][Doom Emacs]]) is to give the left fringe to your VCS and the right to Flycheck (or vice-versa).

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

* Org Mode

** Font Settings

The =efs/org-font-setup= function adjusts the sizes of headings and uses variable-width fonts in most cases so that it looks more like we're editing a document. We switch back to fixed width (monospace) fonts for code blocks and tables so that they display correctly.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (defun efs/org-font-setup ()
    ;; Replace list hyphen with dot
    (font-lock-add-keywords 'org-mode

** Toggle Markup Visibility

[[https://github.com/awth13/org-appear][org-appear]] is an invaluable package that makes it much easier to edit Org documents when =org-hide-emphasis-markers= is active. It temporarily makes concealed markup elements appear when the cursor enters an element. By default, toggling is instaneous and applies only to emphasis markers, but additional functionality can be enabled via custom variables.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

  (use-package org-appear
    :hook (org-mode . org-appear-mode)
    ;; :custom
    ;; (org-appear-autolinks t)  ;; toggle links
    ;; (org-appear-delay 0.5)    ;; delay before toggling
  )

** Heading Bullets

[[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][org-bullets]] replaces the heading stars in Org-mode buffers with nicer-looking characters that you can customize.  Another option for this is [[https://github.com/integral-dw/org-superstar-mode][org-superstar-mode]].

** Block Templates

These let you type things like =<el= and then hit =Tab= to expand the template.
See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Structure-Templates.html][Structure Templates]] in the Org Mode manual, and [[https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel/languages/index.html][Babel Languages]] for supported languages and their identifiers.
